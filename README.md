fvm flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

If you want, you can use the watcher to generate code during development:

```bash
fvm flutter pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

```bash
fvm flutter run -d chrome --web-renderer html --web-port 4200 --web-browser-flag --disable-web-security
```
